# What is zebleckbux
This tool is a black box-style observability system designed to capture and preserve 
critical runtime data—such as logs, metrics, Kubernetes events, configurations, 
and secrets—at key moments like incidents or anomalies. It supports custom triggers, 
multiple storage backends, and automatic expiration to manage data efficiently. 
With a pluggable architecture, it’s highly extensible and can integrate with 
various data sources or services. The tool aims to streamline troubleshooting 
by providing a complete snapshot of system state, with future plans to 
incorporate AI-driven insights, visual dashboards, and anomaly detection 
for faster root cause analysis.

# Logo Explained
The logo shows a cartoon-style French detective dressed in a classic mime-inspired outfit — 
black beret, striped shirt, red scarf — with a thin, twirly mustache and a monocle, 
holding an orange flight recorder (commonly known as a black box) in one hand and 
inspecting it closely with a magnifying glass in the other. This imagery cleverly 
fuses the idea of post-incident investigation with a playful French character, 
symbolizing a tool that “investigates” or retrieves critical data after a failure. 
The detective metaphor communicates scrutiny and attention to detail, while the black box 
evokes aviation-style logging — together, they represent a product built for 
uncovering the truth inside system crashes or mysterious bugs.
